# Single Document Extractive Summarization using Domination in Hypergraphs.

Extractive summaries are formed by picking up the most important sentences and phrases from the document. This research project aims to generate an extractive summary by creating a sentence hypergraph where each sentence represents a node and the edge is a keyword or a named entity that contains the sentences in which it occurs. Once the hypergraph is created, sentence extraction is formulated as a dominating set problem.
